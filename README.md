# dinosaur_generator
A web app that uses two different APIs to fetch a dinosaur name from Dino Ipsum's API and a dinosaur image from Bing's image API. It uses Express for the backend end logic. Then, clicking the button on the front end makes a request to the server which would then make the request.
To use this project, you need to install your node modules and get your API KEY from rapidApi's website. here https://rapidapi.com/
The two API's i used are
  1. https://rapidapi.com/alexnormand/api/dino-ipsum/
  2. https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-image-search1/
